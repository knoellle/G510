# Modified g15daemon for the Logitech G510 Keyboard

Based on [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1421825](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1421825).

See below for a list of changes I made.
Might add some more widgets later on.

# Installation:
On arch linux, running the `./install.sh` script should be sufficient.

# Modifications
- Original source code wouldn't compile, fixed that.
- Fixed macro script execution
- Changed default color to green
